# Project Title: Portfolio

This project is a simple portfolio webpage that includes a navigation bar, a welcome section, and a projects section. The webpage is responsive and changes the background color to light blue when the viewport width is 600px or less.

## HTML Structure

The HTML file (`html.html`) includes the following main sections:

1. **Navigation Bar (`navbar`)**: Contains links to the 'Welcome' and 'Projects' sections of the page.

2. **Welcome Section (`welcome-section`)**: Contains a greeting message.

3. **Projects Section (`projects`)**: Contains a placeholder for project tiles and a link to the GitHub profile.

## CSS Styles

The CSS file (`styles.css`) provides the following styles:

1. **Media Query**: Changes the background color of the body to light blue when the viewport width is 600px or less.

2. **Welcome Section**: Sets the height of the welcome section to 100vh.

3. **Navigation Bar**: Positions the navigation bar as fixed and gives it a semi-transparent background color.

4. **Heading 1**: Positions the `h1` element relatively and moves it down by 10% of the height of its containing block.
